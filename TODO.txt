Short
-----
[ ] Make remote names required
[ ] Ensure remote name <1024 bytes
[x] Implement FileIndex requests
[ ] Print errors and warnings using proper lib
[ ] Standardise use of 'filename' vs 'filepath' in update(), line 64
[ ] Handle os.path.join with FileIndex keys
    - e.g. if joins with '\' and receive FI from OS with '/', how to handle this?
[x] Move before download or download before move?
    -> download first
[ ] Look into e.g. ../../ in filenames received as FI and in FS
[ ] Extend recv for arbitrary size files

Medium
------
[ ] Think about deletions/renames
    - $ pyfilesync rm <file>
    - $ pyfilesync mv <current> <new>
[ ] IP update for peers on change
[ ] SSL - requires learning stuff

Long
----
[ ] Send only changes in files?
