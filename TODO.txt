Short
-----
[ ] Test notifications on MacOS
[x] Split FI update into build/update
[x] Split up monolithic main.py
[x] Make remote names required
[x] Implement FileIndex requests
[ ] Print errors and warnings using proper lib
[x] Standardise use of 'filename' vs 'filepath' in Remote update()
[ ] Handle os.path.join with FileIndex keys
    - e.g. if joins with '\' and receive FI from OS with '/', how to handle this?
[x] Move before download or download before move?
    -> download first
[ ] Look into e.g. ../../ in filenames received as FI and in FS
[x] Extend recv for arbitrary size files

    - $ pyfilesync rm <file>
    - $ pyfilesync mv <current> <new>
[ ] Tray icon
[ ] IP update for peers on change
[ ] SSL - requires learning stuff

Long
